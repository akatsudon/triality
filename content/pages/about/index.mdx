I'm an experienced full-stack developer crafting robust, complex, pixel-perfect digital products and leading development in an Agile environment. I love turning ideas into beautiful\* solutions that solve challenging problems and make things easier for people.

I'm trilingual. I love music (playing the piano as a hobby). I code.

\* literally on the frontend and figuratively on the API :)
