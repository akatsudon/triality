This post covers specific setups required for BrowserStack to reach your Angular localhost site that integrates with Auth0. For standard testing, refer to my [previous post](/localhost-mac-os-i-os-safari-testing-on-windows).

## Setup

In short, Auth0 doesnâ€™t work with the bs-local.com custom domain BrowserStack uses to get around localhost address not being accessible on iOS devices(iPhone & iPad).

To get around this:

### 1. Serve your app using a private IP address

Grab your private IP address from your network/wifi properties page then:

```noLineNumbers
nx serve --host [YOUR_IP]
```

### 2. Auth0 - Application Settings

In Auth0 - Application Settings, add [YOUR_IP]:4200 to the:

- Allowed Callback URLs
- Allowed Web Origins
- Allowed Origins (CORS) fields.

In the Angular app.config.json, change the redirectUrl to [YOUR_IP]:4200.

http://[YOUR_IP]:4200 should then load up in BrowserStack's iOS devices.
